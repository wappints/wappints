### Welcome to my RepoHub ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ I am a 3rd-year student in [De La Salle University (DLSU)](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/) 
undertaking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Major in Computer Systems Engineering.


ðŸ’¬ Our working thesis is initially titled "Design and Development of a Computer-Assisted Road Physical Feature Extraction" or short for RFEX. 
It focuses on extracting certain road physical features that falls under livability and storing it in a database. 
This study will be significant towards future works that will involve assessing livability of a certain area, 
in relation to fields of urban planning and development.

ðŸ’¬ My interests are quite spread out in the field, so I like being the jack of all trades <3
