### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a third-year student in [De La Salle University (DLSU)](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/) 
undertaking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science: Major in Computer Systems Engineering.

You may check my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeohany/) for more information about me! 
Our working thesis is initially titled "Design and Development of a Computer-Assisted Road Physical Feature Extraction" or short for RFEX. 
It focuses on extracting certain road physical features that falls under livability and storing it in a database. 
This study will be useful towards future works that will involve assessing livability of a certain area, 
in relation to fields of urban planning and development.
